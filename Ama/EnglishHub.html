            Speech is the expression of ideas and thoughts by means of articulate vocal sounds,
             or the faculty of thus expressing ideas and thoughts. Language is a set of conventional signs,
              not necessarily articulate or even vocal (any set of signs, signals, or symbols that convey meaning, 
              including written words, may be called language): a spoken language. Thus, language is the set of conventions,
               and speech is the action of putting these to use: He couldn't understand the speech of the natives because it was 
               in a foreign language.<br>
